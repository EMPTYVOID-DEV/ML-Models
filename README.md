# Machine Learning Models Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Models repository! This repository contains a collection of datasets and machine learning models implemented in Python. The goal is to provide a resource for learning and experimenting with various machine learning techniques.

## Datasets

The `datasets` directory contains a variety of datasets used for training and evaluating machine learning models. Each dataset is stored in a separate directory and includes a brief description of its purpose and features.

### Example:

- `datasets/Salary_Data.csv`: This is a simple dataset of university employees salaries relative to their years of experience.

## Models

The `models` directory houses Python scripts implementing various machine learning models.

### Example:

- `models/linear_regression.py`: This python file contains the implementation of a simple linear regression model using Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shinji13/ML-Models.git
   cd ML-Models
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore Datasets:**
   Browse the `datasets` directory to find the dataset you are interested in.

4. **Run Models:**
   Explore the `models` directory and run the provided scripts or notebooks to train and evaluate different machine learning models.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have implemented a new model, added a dataset, or improved existing code, feel free to submit a pull request.
