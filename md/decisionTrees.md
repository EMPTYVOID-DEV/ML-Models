# Decision Trees

Decision Trees are a versatile and interpretable machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They recursively partition the data based on the most significant features, creating a tree-like structure that represents a series of decisions. Decision Trees are popular for their simplicity, interpretability, and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.

## Key Concepts

### Tree Structure

A Decision Tree is composed of nodes, where each node represents a decision based on a specific feature. The tree structure consists of root nodes, internal nodes, and leaf nodes. Internal nodes make decisions, and leaf nodes represent the final predicted outcome.

### Splitting Criteria

The algorithm selects the best feature to split the data at each node. The choice is based on a splitting criterion, commonly using metrics like Gini impurity for classification or mean squared error for regression. The goal is to maximize homogeneity within the resulting subsets.

### Recursive Partitioning

The process of decision-making is recursive. The dataset is split into subsets at each node, and the same decision process is applied to each subset until a stopping criterion is met.

## Applications

Decision Trees find applications in various domains, including:

- **Classification:** Predicting the class labels of instances.
- **Regression:** Predicting numerical values.
- **Decision Support Systems:** Assisting decision-making in complex scenarios.
- **Risk Analysis:** Evaluating potential outcomes based on decision paths.
